# PACEM - Plateau d'Ambiance Contrôlant l'Eclairage et la Musique

PACEM is an immersive ambiance system designed for tabletop role-playing games (TTRPGs) like Dungeons & Dragons. It dynamically adjusts background music and LED lighting based on the game master's descriptions. The system consists of:

 - A voice recognition program that analyzes the game master's descriptions and extracts keywords.

 - A database of over 90 tracks, categorized by mood and theme.

 - An Arduino-controlled LED strip (WS2812B) that adjusts colors and effects according to the scene.

 - A user-friendly tkinter interface for manual and automatic control.
