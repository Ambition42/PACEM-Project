What is the PACEM ?

It is a device used in roleplay games to create an atmosphere adapted to the player's situation.
By controlling lighting and music, the PACEM makes every game seem more realistic, dynamic and immersive.

In order to function, the PACEM uses voice recognition to collect the Dungeon Master's words and choose an adapted music and light.
