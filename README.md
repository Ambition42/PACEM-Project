# PACEM - Plateau d'Ambiance Contr√¥lant l'Eclairage et la Musique

PACEM is an immersive ambiance system designed for tabletop role-playing games (TTRPGs) like Dungeons & Dragons. It dynamically adjusts background music and LED lighting based on the game master's descriptions. The system consists of:

 - A voice recognition program that analyzes the game master's descriptions and extracts keywords.

 - A database of over 90 tracks, categorized by mood and theme.

 - An Arduino-controlled LED strip (WS2812B) that adjusts colors and effects according to the scene.

 - A user-friendly tkinter interface for manual and automatic control.

For now, the PACEM can only understand descriptions in french. Our team is currently working on an improved version, where users will be able to choose their language.
