Hello, player !

Several improvements will be made in the next weeks for the PACEM, including :
- A use of Google Speech to Text API. Users who want this functionnality will have to obtain more information on Google Cloud Platform. However, a free version of the code will still be available.
- Integration of multi-threading in python to maximise the program's speed
- A larger vocabulary
- Special sound effects adapted to the description (only if you use Google Speech to Text API)
- A new pack of musics
- An improvement to the user's interface.
